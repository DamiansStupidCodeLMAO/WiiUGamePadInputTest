# Wii U GamePad Input Test
A basic input tester for the Wii U GamePad, written for LÖVE Potion

Mainly written to try out the LÖVE Potion engine and get an understanding of it.

## How to Use:
There are 2 methods to use this software.

1. The WUHB File
There should be a precompiled WUHB in the Releases section of this repository. It has everything bundled in, so just toss it into `sdmc:/wiiu/apps/` and it should appear on your home menu!

2. The LÖVE Potion Method
Grab a copy of [LÖVE Potion](https://github.com/lovebrew/lovepotion) and place the WUHB file at `sdmc:/wiiu/apps/lovepotion/lovepotion.wuhb`. It is required that you use a 3.1.0 build of LÖVE Potion, so you need to grab the binary from GitHub Actions. This may change in the future.

Then, copy the game files from this repo to `sdmc:/wiiu/apps/lovepotion/game/`. Now, you can run the software by launching LÖVE Potion. As far as I'm aware, this is the only method for running this software on "Legacy" CFW. Take this with a grain of salt, as it's untested
